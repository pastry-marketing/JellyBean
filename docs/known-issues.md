## P1 — CI gates (resolved 2026-10-01)

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` gates every push and PR on two commands. Both are
now clean.

| Check                            | Result                     |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `bunx tsc --noEmit`              | ✅ **0 errors** (was 34)   |
| `bunx eslint . --max-warnings 0` | ✅ **0 warnings** (was 35) |
| `bun run test:run`               | ✅ 46 / 46                 |

Both were resolved. See [Resolved — 34 TypeScript errors](#resolved--34-typescript-errors)
and [Resolved — 35 ESLint warnings](#resolved--35-eslint-warnings) below.

Note: `vitest run` is still **not** part of CI. Adding it is a one-line change to
the workflow — see [P5](#p5--tests-do-not-run-in-ci).

## Resolved — 35 ESLint warnings

Fixed 2026-10-01. Split into the two rules that produced them.

### `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` (21)

**14 — unstable memo dependencies (real performance bugs).** These were
`useMemo` values whose dependencies were `x.data ?? []`. The `?? []` allocates
a fresh array on every render, so the dependent `useMemo`s **never actually
memoised** — they recomputed on every render, which is exactly what they exist
to avoid.

Fixed by wrapping each in its own `useMemo`, keyed on the underlying query
result:

| Location            | Value                                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `app.analytics.tsx` | `series`, `prevSeries`, `csBuckets`, `forwarders` |
| `app.analytics.tsx` | `deptRows`, `rawRows`                             |
| `app.reports.tsx`   | `rawUsers`, `allProfiles`                         |

**2 — genuinely missing, safe to add.**

| Location                  | Dependency   | Why safe                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app.submit-lead.tsx:233` | `isFacebook` | A `boolean` primitive — stable identity                                   |
| `app.cs-leads.tsx:1168`   | `qc`         | The context QueryClient singleton; identity is fixed for the app lifetime |

Adding `qc` keeps that effect mount-once: a stable dependency does not
re-trigger it.

**5 — deliberately suppressed in `app.crisp-chat.tsx`.** Lines 715, 720, 735,
746, 891. These are **not** oversights, and the rule's advice would be harmful
here.

`loadConversations`, `loadMessages`, `loadNotes`, `loadWorkspaces` and
`loadWorkspaceCounts` are plain `async` functions declared in the component
body, so each has a **new identity on every render**. The page already works
around this deliberately: it mirrors mutable state into refs
(`selectedConversationIdRef`, `selectedWebsiteIdRef`, `workspacesRef`) precisely
so these effects can stay mount-once.

Listing the loaders as dependencies would re-run those effects on **every
render**. For the effect at line 891 that means tearing down and rebuilding the
Supabase Realtime channel and the 30 s polling interval on every render — and
`app.cs-leads.tsx` carries an explicit comment that a duplicate Realtime
subscription would _double message billing for every CS user_.

Each suppression therefore carries a comment explaining the intent, matching the
existing `eslint-disable` precedent in `src/lib/lead-attachments.ts`.

> **Recommended follow-up:** stabilise the loaders with `useCallback` so the
> rule can be satisfied honestly. Two blockers make that non-trivial:
> `loadConversations` reads `convPage` and `searchQuery` as state, and
> `convPage` drives infinite-scroll pagination — `convPage: 0 → 1` would
> change the loader's identity and re-trigger the workspace effect, which
> resets the page to 0. That needs mirroring `convPage` into a ref, and should
> be done with the conversation list open in a browser, not blind.

### `react-refresh/only-export-components` (14)

Mixed non-component exports out of component modules, so Fast Refresh works
correctly during development.

| Location                        | Action                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `components/confirm-dialog.tsx` | Moved `confirmDialog`, `confirmDiscardUnsaved`, types and the pending store into new `confirm-dialog-store.ts`; provider now binds via `bindConfirmDialogProvider` |
| `lib/lead-attachments.tsx`      | Split into `lead-attachments.ts` (`toStoragePath`, `useSignedLeadUrls`) and a component-only `lead-attachments.tsx` (`SignedLeadImage`)                            |
| `components/lead-form.tsx`      | Moved `formatPhoneInput` and `uploadLeadImages` into new `lib/lead-form-utils.ts`                                                                                  |
| `routes/app.crisp-chat.tsx`     | Six helpers are file-local only — dropped the `export` keyword                                                                                                     |
| `routes/app.reports.tsx`        | `CS_LABELS` / `CS_STATUS_COLORS` are file-local only — dropped `export`                                                                                            |

Import sites were updated: 7 files now import from `confirm-dialog-store`, 2
from `lead-form-utils`.

Two duplication findings worth noting, left alone deliberately:

- **`CS_LABELS` is defined three times** — `app.reports.tsx`, `app.analytics.tsx`
  and `app.index.tsx`. They are **not** identical: coverage differs and casing
  differs (`"Wrong Number"` vs `"Wrong number"`). These look intentionally
  page-specific, so consolidating them would change rendered labels and needs a
  product decision, not a lint fix.
- **`isCrispMaskedMessage` is defined three times** — `app.crisp-chat.tsx`,
  `components/crisp-message-notifier.tsx` and `lib/crisp.server.ts`. The bodies
  are equivalent, but two of the copies sit on the client and one on the server,
  so a shared import would need care. Left as-is.

## Resolved — 34 TypeScript errors

Fixed 2026-10-01. `bunx tsc --noEmit` now reports **0 errors**; `bun run lint`
reports **0 errors / 35 warnings**; tests remain **46 / 46**.

The 34 errors reduced to four root causes. Kept here because the same patterns
will recur as the Crisp integration grows.

**(a) `TS2589` — excessively deep type instantiation**

The generated `Database` type in `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts` is ~1,718
lines covering 24 tables, 3 views, ~40 functions and 3 enums. When
`SupabaseClient<Database>` was passed into helpers that declared their own
hand-rolled structural client type, TypeScript had to instantiate the entire
generated schema to check the match and exhausted its budget.

This one error caused most of the other 33 — the `TS2345` argument errors
elsewhere in `crisp.functions.ts` were the same generic collapsing one level up.

_Fix applied:_ `assertCrispAccess` and `assertAdmin` now accept the client as
`unknown` and narrow once through a shared `fetchCallerRoles` helper, so
accepting a client costs no structural comparison. A deliberately shallow
`RoleQueryClient` type with `unknown` leaves documents the one query performed.
No `any` was introduced.

**(b) `TS2339` — untyped Crisp JSON payloads** _(the highest-value fix)_

Crisp returns attachment payloads as untyped JSON. Because
`MessageRecord.raw_payload` was `Record<string, unknown>`, a
`typeof x === "object"` guard narrowed to bare `object`, so reading `.url`,
`.size`, or `.duration` failed to compile. A mistyped attachment field
silently drops a customer's photo, so these were the errors most worth fixing
properly rather than casting away.

_Fix applied:_ introduced explicit `CrispAttachmentContent` and `CrispRawPayload`
shapes, narrowed once into a local `attachmentContent`, and reused that
reference for the later `duration` read. `crisp.server.ts`'s
`parseMessageContent` now narrows `raw` to `Record<string, unknown>` before
reading `.text` / `.name`.

**(c) `TS2339` — wrong result shape on a query builder** — `crisp.server.ts:255`

`.data` / `.error` were destructured from a builder whose type did not model
PostgREST's dual nature.

_Fix applied:_ `QueryBuilder` is now an `interface` extending `PromiseLike<…>`,
so it is both chainable (`.select().eq().eq().maybeSingle()`) and awaitable
(`await …upsert(rows).select("id")`). `update` correctly returns `QueryBuilder`.

**(d) `TS2322` — object-literal shape mismatches**

- `crisp.functions.ts` — the Crisp API response was cast to
  `{ … } & Record<string, unknown>`, which is not assignable to the `Json`
  column type. Now cast to `Json`, which is what `res.json()` actually returns.
- `crisp-message-notifier.tsx` — `conversation_id` was `string | undefined` but
  is used both to fetch the conversation and to build the alert. Added a real
  guard (`if (!newMsg?.id || !newMsg.conversation_id) return;`) rather than a
  cast, since an alert without a conversation cannot be actioned.
- `nextdoor-leads-webhook.ts` — the row types declared
  `data?: Record<string, string> | null` while the column is JSONB. `data` was
  never read from those rows, so the unused field was dropped from the type
  instead of being cast.

---

### Note on dead code

`noUnusedLocals` and `noUnusedParameters` are both `false` in `tsconfig.json`,
and `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` is `"off"` in the ESLint config, so dead
code is not currently flagged anywhere. Worth enabling deliberately at some
point — expect a non-trivial first pass.

---

## P2 — Trust page contradicts platform configuration

`src/routes/trust.tsx:35` states there is "no public sign-up". The Supabase
project reports `disable_signup: false`, so the auth API **does** accept
self-registration.

Mitigations already in place: the app ships no sign-up form; `/app` renders a
"No role assigned" screen for role-less accounts; email confirmation is required
(`mailer_autoconfirm: false`).

Because `/trust` is a compliance-facing document, it should not assert something
the platform contradicts. Either disable sign-up in Supabase Auth settings or
reword the claim to describe what the _application_ enforces rather than what
the _platform_ permits.

Full method and evidence: [`backend-verification.md`](backend-verification.md) §5.

---

## P3 — Misleading migration filename

`supabase/migrations/20260707130000_make_lead_attachments_bucket_public.sql`
implies the `lead-attachments` bucket is public. **Live behaviour contradicts
it** — the bucket is not readable without credentials, and `/trust`'s "private
bucket" claim is the accurate one. Verified by comparing against a control
bucket name; see [`backend-verification.md`](backend-verification.md) §4.

Either confirm the migration was never applied to production, or document the
effective state so a future reader does not "fix" the bucket to public by
mistake.

---

## P4 — Credential hygiene

**Long-lived anon JWT committed to source.** `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts:27`
falls back to a 208-character `anon` JWT valid until ≈ 2036. It is an `anon` key
so RLS still applies and this is not a direct breach, but it means every fork
inherits a credential, and rotation requires a code change. Prefer requiring
`VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and failing loudly when it is absent.

**`sbp_…` publishable key rejected.** The publishable key supplied during the
2026-10-01 audit returned `UNAUTHORIZED_INVALID_API_KEY` from the gateway —
stale or rotated. The legacy JWT is what currently works. Confirm which key is
authoritative; see [`backend-verification.md`](backend-verification.md).

---

## P5 — Tests do not run in CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `tsc` and `eslint` but **not** `vitest run`, and
there is no coverage reporting. The 46 existing tests would not catch a
regression on their own. Adding `bun run test:run` to the workflow is a
one-line change with clear value.

Test coverage is unit-only — no component, integration, or E2E layer exists.

---

## P6 — Documentation drift already addressed

The previous `README.md` was materially wrong. Corrected in the 2026-10-01
documentation pass:

| Was                                    | Reality                                            |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Role `processor`                       | Renamed to `maturing` (migration `20260619183000`) |
| `cs_admin` missing entirely            | One of nine roles                                  |
| AI model `gpt-5-nano`                  | `gpt-5.4-nano-2026-03-17`                          |
| No mention of Crisp                    | 4 edge functions, 5 tables, 11 server functions    |
| No mention of the access-code gate     | Required second factor for all non-admins          |
| No mention of Vault-backed credentials | Central to the Crisp design                        |

Also stale or misleading:

- **`.lovable/plan.md`** — an 8-stage performance plan that was never started.
  None of `src/lib/queries/`, `src/components/skeletons/`,
  `@tanstack/react-virtual`, or URL-driven pagination exists. It ends with
  "Confirm and I'll start with stage 1". Treat as a proposal, not a description
  of the system.
- **`docs/cs-pipeline-two-best-questions-plan.md`** — untracked. A
  20-section specification for conversational lead qualification that is
  **not implemented**. It references `OPENAI_COMPOSER_MODEL` and treats the
  `gpt-5.4-nano-2026-03-17` model as configurable; neither is true today. It is
  a forward-looking proposal, not a description of current behaviour.
- **`OPENAI_MODEL`** in `.env.example` — no code reads it. Model IDs are pinned
  in `raw-leads-ai.functions.ts`.
- **`VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID`** — declared, never read.
- **`VITE_GOOGLE_SHEETS_WEBHOOK_URL`** — read by `google-sheets-sync.ts:28` but
  was absent from `.env.example`. Now documented.

---

## P7 — Dead and orphaned code

Candidates for removal, none urgent:

- `emergency-dashboard.html` and `generate_emergency_tool.py` — a standalone
  recovery page loading Supabase from a CDN. Not part of the build, referenced by
  no route.
- `google-sheets-sync-code.js` (v2.6) — the Apps Script source, useful as an
  operational reference but sits at repo root rather than in `docs/`.
- Declared but unreferenced dependencies: `qrcode`, `@fontsource/epilogue`,
  `@fontsource/urbanist`, `@cloudflare/vite-plugin`, `@hookform/resolvers`,
  `@tanstack/router-plugin`.
- `.output/` and `.wrangler/` build residue is gitignored but present locally.

---

## P8 — Unverified against production

From the read-only audit: the **~40 RPCs** in `types.ts` could not be confirmed
present in the live database without executing them, and several have side
effects. Any runtime dependency on a specific RPC signature should be verified
from an authenticated session.

The two materialized views (`mv_qualified_leads_status_counts`,
`mv_raw_lead_cache_counts`) correctly deny `anon`; the app reaches them via
service role, so this is expected.

---

## Suggested order of work

1. **1.1(a)** — fix the `TS2589` generic collapse; it likely clears ~8 errors
2. **1.1(b)** — type the Crisp payloads; highest real-world risk
3. **1.1(c, d)** — small, mechanical
4. **1.2** — exhaustive-deps and fast-refresh warnings
5. **P5** — add `vitest run` to CI
6. **P2 / P3 / P4** — trust page wording, migration naming, credential rotation
