# Architecture

How JellyBean is put together: the request lifecycle, the data layer, caching
and realtime strategy, and the conventions that new code is expected to follow.

For a system overview and setup instructions see the [README](../README.md). For
production findings see [`backend-verification.md`](backend-verification.md).

---

## 1. Rendering model

JellyBean is a **server-rendered React application** built on TanStack Start. The
Nitro server handles the initial request, renders the route tree on the server,
and streams the result; the client then takes over as a normal SPA.

```
Browser ──▶ Nitro (src/server.ts)
              │
              ├─▶ errorMiddleware        ← requestMiddleware, src/start.ts
              │     catches anything without a statusCode and renders a
              │     branded 500 page instead of a stack trace
              │
              ├─▶ route match            ← src/routeTree.gen.ts (generated)
              │     shellComponent: RootShell  (src/routes/__root.tsx)
              │     notFoundComponent / errorComponent
              │
              ├─▶ server functions       ← createServerFn, one HTTP round trip
              │     requireSupabaseAuth middleware attaches a request-scoped
              │     Supabase client + userId to context
              │
              └─▶ Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Realtime)
```

### Entry points

| File                           | Responsibility                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/server.ts`                | SSR entry. Wraps `fetch`, normalises h3's swallowed `{"unhandled":true}` 500s into the branded error page |
| `src/start.ts`                 | `createStart()` — registers `errorMiddleware` and `attachSupabaseAuth`                                    |
| `src/router.tsx`               | Creates the router and a `QueryClient` per router instance                                                |
| `src/routeTree.gen.ts`         | **Generated.** Never hand-edit; regenerate via the router plugin                                          |
| `server/plugins/env-bridge.ts` | Copies Cloudflare `globalThis.__env__` into `process.env` on each request                                 |

### Auth propagation

The client never talks to the database directly for privileged work. Instead:

1. `attachSupabaseAuth` (`src/integrations/supabase/auth-attacher.ts`) runs as
   `functionMiddleware` on **every** server function and forwards the browser's
   `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` header.
2. `requireSupabaseAuth` (`src/integrations/supabase/auth-middleware.ts`) requires
   a Bearer token, builds a **request-scoped** Supabase client pinned to that
   token, validates it with `supabase.auth.getClaims(token)`, and injects
   `{ supabase, userId, claims }` into the handler context.
3. Handlers use that request-scoped client, so **Postgres RLS applies using the
   real user's identity**. This is why most server functions do not need
   hand-written role checks — the database enforces it. Handlers add explicit
   checks only for finer-grained rules (for example `requireUserManager`).

`auth-middleware.ts` is marked auto-generated — edit `client.ts` patterns rather
than that file.

### Service-role escape hatch

`src/integrations/supabase/client.server.ts` exports `supabaseAdmin`, a lazily
initialised `Proxy` around a service-role client. Service role **bypasses RLS**.

It exists for legitimate privileged operations — bulk AI decision writes, Crisp
credential Vault access, admin user provisioning. Use it only where RLS
legitimately cannot express the rule, and never return its results to a caller
who should not see them.

---

## 2. Authorization layers

Access is checked four times over. A change to any single layer cannot grant
access on its own.

| #   | Layer           | File                                       | Enforces                                                  |
| --- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Route guard     | `src/routes/app.tsx`                       | Session, `is_active`, role present, non-admin access code |
| 2   | Render gate     | `RoleGate`, `src/components/page.tsx:56`   | Per-route role allow-list                                 |
| 3   | Server function | `requireSupabaseAuth` + per-handler checks | Token validity, role delegation rules                     |
| 4   | Database        | RLS policies (`supabase/migrations/`)      | Row-level authorisation                                   |

### Role resolution

`primaryRole` is a fixed precedence chain, not "the first role found"
(`src/hooks/use-auth.ts:158`):

```
admin > sub_admin > cs_admin > scraping > maturing > cs > acc_handler > facebook > seo
```

Navigation is derived from `primaryRole` only, in
`src/components/app-shell.tsx:59`. `admin` and `sub_admin` additionally receive
grouped navigation (Operations / Customer service / Intelligence /
Administration); everyone else gets a single flat group.

Because navigation and rendering are driven by one function, adding a role means
touching three places: the `AppRole` union, the Postgres `app_role` enum, and
`itemsForRole()`. Keep them in sync.

---

## 3. Data access patterns

### Server functions

All server-side data access goes through `createServerFn` from
`@tanstack/react-start`. The convention:

```ts
export const someOperation = createServerFn({ method: "GET" })
  .middleware([requireSupabaseAuth])
  .inputValidator(zodSchema)
  .handler(async ({ data, context }) => {
    const { supabase, userId } = context; // request-scoped, RLS applies
    // …
  });
```

Every boundary validates with Zod. Validation is not optional here — these
functions are reachable over HTTP.

There are exactly two deliberate exceptions, both documented in code:

- `bootstrapFirstAdmin` — unauthenticated, safe only because it hard-fails once
  any profile or admin exists
- `saveGoogleSheetsConfigServerFn` — a tier-3 fallback in the Sheets config
  cascade

### Client → server

Routes call server functions through `useServerFn(...)`. Results are cached by
TanStack Query.

### Bypassing the ORM

There is no ORM. PostgREST query builders are used directly
(`.from("table").select(...).eq(...)`). Note that PostgREST infers result types
only from **terminal** methods — a bare builder has no `.data` / `.error`. Await
the builder, or apply `.single()` / `.maybeSingle()`.

---

## 4. Caching and client state

### Server state — TanStack Query v5

Configured once per router instance in `src/router.tsx`:

```ts
new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      staleTime: 60_000, // 1 minute
      gcTime: 10 * 60_000, // 10 minutes
      refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
      refetchOnReconnect: false,
      retry: 1,
    },
  },
});
```

Refetch-on-focus and refetch-on-reconnect are **off by design**: this app is
polling plus realtime-driven, and focus-refetching every query on tab switch
produced redundant database load. Mutations invalidate explicitly via
`queryClient.invalidateQueries`.

Use `placeholderData: keepPreviousData` for paginated lists so page transitions
do not flash empty.

### Client state — React Context only

No Redux, Zustand, or Jotai. Two providers exist:

- `AuthProvider` / `useAuth()` — `src/hooks/use-auth.ts`
- `ConfirmDialogProvider` — `src/components/confirm-dialog.tsx`

Everything else is local `useState` / `useMemo` / `useRef`. Toasts use `sonner`.

> Most list pages still hold pagination and filters in component state rather
> than the URL. Only `/app/settings` and `/app/cs-leads` use `validateSearch`.
> URL-driven filter state was proposed in `.lovable/plan.md` and never started.

---

## 5. Realtime

Three Supabase Realtime channels, each scoped to what a role actually needs.

| Channel                      | Hook                       | Scope                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `crm-realtime-sync`          | `use-realtime-sync.ts`     | Per-role table set via `ROLE_TABLES`; 400 ms debounced invalidation; also dispatches Google Sheets sync on `qualified_leads` changes |
| `crisp-unread-nav-sync`      | `use-crisp-unread.ts`      | `crisp_conversations` + `crisp_workspaces`; 30 s heartbeat; refresh on `visibilitychange`                                            |
| `pending-reminders-nav-sync` | `use-pending-reminders.ts` | `lead_reminders`; 30 s poll; refresh on `visibilitychange`                                                                           |

Three design rules worth preserving:

1. **One channel per concern.** Commit `660462f` removed redundant duplicate
   subscriptions. Do not add a fourth channel for a new feature — extend
   `ROLE_TABLES` instead.
2. **Subscribe by role, not by page.** A user should not receive realtime events
   for tables they cannot read.
3. **Always pair realtime with a poll.** Realtime is an optimisation, not a
   guarantee; both nav badges poll on a 30 s heartbeat for that reason.

`raw_leads` and the Crisp tables use `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` for broadcast
support.

---

## 6. Timezones

Deliberately inconsistent, and the single most likely source of subtle bugs:

| Scope                | Zone                         | Module                        |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Application-wide     | `Asia/Karachi` (PKT)         | `src/lib/timezone.ts`         |
| **CS Pipeline only** | `America/New_York` (Eastern) | `src/lib/cs-pipeline-time.ts` |
| Stored timestamps    | UTC (`timestamptz`)          | Postgres                      |

The CS Pipeline's Eastern-time window governs which day a lead belongs to for
CS purposes, while the rest of the app reports in PKT. Before changing either
module, read both — and check
`src/lib/cs-pipeline-time.test.ts`, which pins the boundary behaviour.

---

## 7. Domain model

| Entity         | Table                                                                                                           | Notes                                                  |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Raw lead       | `raw_lead_cache`                                                                                                | Nextdoor scrape output. `data` is JSONB. Largest table |
| Raw lead       | `raw_leads`                                                                                                     | Reviewable leads with AI decisions                     |
| Qualified lead | `qualified_leads`                                                                                               | The CS pipeline record                                 |
| Identity       | `profiles`, `user_roles`, `user_access_codes`                                                                   |                                                        |
| Assignment     | `service_assignments`, `state_assignments`                                                                      | Auto-routing rules                                     |
| Crisp          | `crisp_workspaces`, `crisp_conversations`, `crisp_messages`, `crisp_webhook_events`, `crisp_conversation_notes` |                                                        |

### Assignment precedence

A qualified lead's owner resolves in this order
(`src/lib/service-assignment.ts`):

1. Explicit `assigned_to` on the lead
2. Matching `service_assignments` rule
3. Matching `state_assignments` rule

This is also implemented as a database trigger, and
`src/lib/service-assignment.test.ts` asserts the trigger's SQL text so the two
implementations cannot silently diverge.

### Enums

`app_role` (9 values), `cs_status` (21 values), `raw_lead_status`
(`new` / `qualified` / `cancelled`), `raw_lead_cancel_reason` (6 values).

`cs_status` is unusually wide because it encodes real call outcomes —
`wrong_number`, `service_provider_himself`, `already_received_before`,
`small_service`, and similar. Adding a value requires a Postgres enum migration
plus an entry in `STATUS_LABEL` and `STATUS_TONE`
(`src/lib/lead-statuses.ts`).

> `STATUS_TONE` uses explicit Tailwind hex classes rather than token references
> because the token-based classes were being purged from the production bundle.
> Preserve that when editing.

## 8. External integrations

| Integration       | Mechanism                                                      | Credentials                                |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **OpenAI**        | Direct `fetch` to `api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`; no SDK | `OPENAI_API_KEY`                           |
| **Crisp**         | REST + 4 Deno edge functions                                   | Per-workspace tokens in **Supabase Vault** |
| **Google Sheets** | Apps Script webhook from the browser, `mode: "no-cors"`        | URL in `app_settings` / `shared_state`     |
| **Nextdoor**      | Chrome extension → public webhook endpoint                     | Shared secret                              |
| **Incogniton**    | Local Node bridge at `127.0.0.1:27842`                         | Local process only                         |

### AI usage

Two call sites, two models (`src/lib/raw-leads-ai.functions.ts`):

| Purpose        | Model                     | Shape                                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Classification | `gpt-5.4-nano-2026-03-17` | `raw_lead_classification`, `strict: true`, 10 per batch      |
| Rephrasing     | `gpt-4o-mini`             | `lead_lead_rephrase`, returns service context + requirements |

Classification is **batched** — `.in()` lookups chunked by 10, posts under 20
characters skipped, duplicates excluded, at most 50 rows per request, results
written back through the single `batch_update_raw_lead_decisions` RPC.

Responses are parsed and validated by the exported pure function
`parseAndValidateAiResults`, which is directly unit-tested. Keep model
identifiers pinned in code; there is no environment override.

Auto-rephrase is gated by the `shared_state` toggle `cs_auto_rephrase_enabled`,
**off by default**, and never overwrites non-empty `marketing_notes`.

### Why Crisp credentials live in Vault

Crisp multi-workspace tokens are stored in Supabase Vault and linked through
`crisp_workspaces`. The inbound webhook compares its `?key=` against a
per-workspace secret with a timing-safe compare, and reads the token only at
send time. This is why there are deliberately **no** `CRISP_*` environment
variables, and why `crisp-send-message` and `crisp-mark-read` each re-verify the
caller's JWT and role independently.

---

## 9. Conventions for new code

**Routes.** Files in `src/routes` map to URLs. Add `pendingComponent:
() => <RouteSkeleton />` to any route that loads slowly.

**Components.** Feature components live in `src/components/`; shadcn primitives
in `src/components/ui/` and are exempt from the fast-refresh lint rule. Prefer
extending `LeadForm` (`src/components/lead-form.tsx`) over forking it — the
three lead routes share it, and a test asserts all three still render it.

**Server functions.** New file per domain area, named `<domain>.functions.ts`.
Always attach `requireSupabaseAuth` unless there is a documented reason not to,
and always add `.inputValidator()`.

**Migrations.** `supabase migration new <description>`. Never edit an applied
migration. Prefer a new RPC over a wide `select *` when the query is hot — the
I/O work in [`database-io-optimization.md`](database-io-optimization.md) exists
because broad reads were the dominant cost.

**Tests.** Vitest, colocated as `<module>.test.ts`. Target pure logic. When you
fix a bug, add the case that would have caught it.

**Time.** Use the helpers in `src/lib/timezone.ts` or `src/lib/cs-pipeline-time.ts`
rather than calling `new Date()` directly in a component.
